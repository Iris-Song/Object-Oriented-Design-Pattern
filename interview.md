1. Abstraction
   
    It means hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce the complexity of the system. In a large system, objects talk to each other, which makes it difficult to maintain a large code base; abstraction helps by hiding internal implementation details of objects and only revealing operations that are relevant to other objects.
2. Inheritance

    mechanism of creating new classes from existing ones.
   - subclass (super class, parent class, bass class)
   - extened class
   - child class
3. polymorphism

    Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning “many forms”) is the ability of an object to take different forms and thus, depending upon the context, to respond to the same message in different ways.
4. Encapsulation
   
   binding data together and hiding it from the outside world. Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private so that other objects don’t have direct access to its state. Instead, they can access this state only through a set of public functions.
